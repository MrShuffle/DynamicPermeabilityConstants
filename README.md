# Dynamic Permeability Constants


Replication of the algorithm in Yvonne Ou, M.-J. (2014). On reconstruction of dynamic permeability and tortuosity from data at distinct frequencies. Inverse Problems, 30(9), 095002. https://doi.org/10.1088/0266-5611/30/9/095002. The least-square problem is solved using scipy.optimize.least_squares.

The runscript includes different material parameters, two for cancellous bone and one for sandstone. It outputs the constants c_j (poles) and d_j (residues).
